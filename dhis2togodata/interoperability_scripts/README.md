# dhis2-godata-interoperability (WIP)
_developed by WISCENTD (https://github.com/WISCENTD-UPC)_

Scripts to exchange data between dhis2 and Go.Data instances

_see full package here: https://github.com/WISCENTD-UPC/dhis2-godata-interoperability/tree/develop_


## Requirements
- Node.js (>= v12.x) and npm (>= v6.x) installed in the system.

## Installation
- Clone the repository or download it as a zip file.
- In a terminal, install the dependencies by executing npm install inside the project folder.
- Configure the script (more on this below).

## Actions
The functionality of the package is split among different steps.

- node index.js copy-organisation-units : get all organisation units from DHIS2, transforms them to fit Go.Data's schema and saves them hierarchally in a json file in .
- node index.js create-outbreaks: Create Go.Data outbreaks based on the organisation units and tracked entities of the DHIS2 instance. There are two modes available that can be configured in the configuration file: GROUP mode and EXPAND mode. EXPAND mode create one outbreak for each organisation unit with tracked entities, while GROUP mode only creates one outbreak for each group of organisation units under a certain administrative level (that can be configured in the configuration file). GROUP mode is the default value with a grouping level of 0 (i.e.: only one outbreak is going to be created in most cases).
- node index.js copy-cases: transfers tracked entities from DHIS2 to Go.Data, transforming the data to fit Go.Data's schema and assigning an outbreak automatically.

## Configuration
In order to use the dhis2-godata-interoperability script, a couple of things have to be configured in ./config/config.js (some of them are mandatory, like the connection to the APIs, and others have default values that can be used if there's no need for changing them).

Connection to APIs: the first think that needs to be configured is the connection to both DHIS2 and Go.Data. A base endpoint has to be provided for each service, as well as the credentials needed for the authentication.
// Connection example

```
module.exports = {
  GoDataAPIConfig: {
    baseURL: 'http://mygodatainstance.com/api',
    credentials: {
      email: 'test@email.com',
      password: '123412341234'
    }
  },
  DHIS2APIConfig: {
    baseURL: 'https://mydhis2instance.com/api',
    credentials: {
      user: 'dhis2user',
      password: '123412341234'
    }
  }
}
```

Organisation units root: mandatory configuration of the organisation unit used as the root for the hierarchal structure. (i.e. the ID of the DHIS2 organisation unit with level 1, which means administrative level 0 in Go.Data)

```
module.exports = {
  rootID: 'adkfj2o3i'
}
```
Countries: the names of the countries the organisation units represent. In almost all cases this is going to be just one value, but more than one can be provided.

```
module.exports = {
  rootID: [ 'Trainingland' ]
}
```
