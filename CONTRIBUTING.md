## Submitting an Issue

**Before creating a new issue, please search the repository for similar issues first to avoid duplicates!** You can do this by using the search field in the menu bar. If you find an issue that already covers your request or seems very similar, please comment on that issue.

Please make sure to always use one of the templates that are automatically presented to you when [creating a new issue](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/godata/issues/new/choose) because it ensures that your issue is structured and contains all the information that we need.
Issues that have not been created like this will be closed and you will be asked to submit a new issue that adheres to these guidelines.

Please add information to all mandatory sections of the issue templates, and try to fill in the optional sections if possible. Do not remove any section after submitting the issue because they might be filled later by the development team.
While moving forward in the development process, developers might also extend or alter the initial issue description, e.g. to adjust it according to the outcome of a refinement process.

## Security Issues

If you want to report a security issue, please follow our guidelines for [*Responsible Disclosure*](SECURITY.md).

## Issue Types

### Bug Report

Bug reports cover everything that leads to the application behaving in an unintended way, including crashes, unexpected error messages, data loss, etc.

Before creating a bug report, please check the following rules:

1. If something seems to be working correctly but does not necessarily match your expectations of how it should be working, please consider opening a change request instead. This applies also for performance issues.
2. If you have more than one possible bug, especially when you are tempted to create a list of independent findings in the **Bug Description**, please document each bug as separate issue.
3. Bugs should generally only be reported as new issues if they occur on a released version. If a bug only occurs on the current development version, it has very likely been caused by implementation done in the current iteration; in this case, the issue responsible for introducing the bug has to be reopened instead of creating a new issue.
This process helps to keep both the commit history and the release notes clean.

### Feature Request
Feature requests cover everything that involves adding new features to Go.Data.
