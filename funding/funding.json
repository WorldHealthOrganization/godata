It is designed for use by public health workers, particularly first responders, epidemiologists, and contact tracers during outbreak responses. This tool enables responders to collect data in a more structured manner, integrates data sets for comparison across different regions or events, and provides real-time analysis to inform field operations. Additionally, it includes various features to help organize and monitor contact tracing activities effectively (https://www.who.int/tools/godata).",
