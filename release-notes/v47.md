# Release notes - v47.0
## ***22 June 2023***
Go.Data version 47 is now available for download from its usual location. This includes updated Android and iOS apps that can be downloaded from App and GooglePlay stores, in addition to a number fixes and enhancements as outlined below:

** Please don't forget that for MacOS upgrade. you need to use the update functionality from Go.Data application tray menu and do NOT install dmg on top. This will ensure no data loss of backups and uploaded files** 

### Upgrades of underlying software components:
- upgraded MongoDB version to 5.0.18

### Outbreaks:
- implemented outbreak specific reference data (existing outbreaks will display all reference data just as before, until their outbreak specific reference data is configured)

### Events, cases, contacts, and contacts of contacts:
- added missing columns and filters to cases, events and contacts list pages
- added "was a contact" and "was a contact of contacts" info pills to view/modify case
- added "was a case" and "was a contact of contacts" info pills to view/modify contact
- added "was a case" and "was a contact" info pills to view/modify contact of contacts
- added option to convert a contact of a contact to a contact and vice versa
- added bulk deletion/restore of cases, contacts, events, contact of contacts
- fixed an issue where under extremely rare conditions you could see different types on the wrong list pages (e.g. contact of contact list page was displaying cases too)
- fixed an issue where case questionnaire tab on create / modify contact wasn't showing which questions were invalid
- fixed an issue where contact questionnaire tab on create / modify case wasn't showing which questions were invalid
- fixed an issue where contact and case questionnaires tabs on create / modify contact of contact weren't showing which questions were invalid

### Follow-ups:
- fixed an issue where "Follow-up dashboard" page wasn't loading if one or more related contacts were deleted

### Lab results:
- added bulk deletion/restore of lab results

### Locations: 
- changed delete location system to forbid deletion if they are used by follow-ups, outbreaks, teams (for all others this check was already implemented (cases/contacts...))
- added option to set "updated at" dates to current date/time of the server when you export hierarchical locations. This way you can force an import on a system where some of these locations might already exist but they were deleted and you want to restore them.
- fixed an issue where you couldn't import synonyms when importing locations

### Gantt chart:
- fixed an issue where you couldn't export one of the two charts

### Mobile:
- outbreak specific reference data (existing outbreaks will display all reference data just as before until their outbreak specific reference data is configured)
- fixed some sync related issues
- fixed an issue where keyboard was behaving strangely on address
- fixed an issue where you couldn't save the address for an event if that event didn't had an address already

### Other: 
- **[BREAKING CHANGE] removed exposure intensity from reference data categories since it wasn't used by the system. If you're using it please be sure to update your scripts before upgrade**
- restore backup will display progress to have an estimation how much longer until complete
- changed backup restore process to clean tmp folder during restore (remove backup files that were unzipped during restore and that aren't needed anymore)
- added new page to see all backup restores that were run since 47.0 onwards (backups page = > quick actions => backup restores)
- increased the advanced filter dialog width on list pages
- added number of applied filters / sorts in advanced filters dialog on all list pages
- made minor design adjustments
