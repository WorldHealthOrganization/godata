# Welcome to the Go.Data Site! 

This repostiory serves as an [umbrella site](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/) to gear the community towards existing technical documentation, resources, and open source components developed by and for the Go.Data community worldwide, particularly in the area of Analytics and Interoperability.

You can find all additional repos connected to the Go.Data tool in the overarching WHO Github Repository by filtering for topics = "go-data", as seen [here](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization?q=go-data&type=&language=)

## What is Go.Data? 

[Go.Data](https://www.who.int/tools/godata) is a software for contact tracing and outbreak response developed by WHO in collaboration with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Go.Data focuses on case and contact data including laboratory data, hospitalizaton and other variables collected through investigation forms that can be configured across settings and disease types. It generates contact follow-up lists and viusalisation of chains of tranmission. It is currently in use in over 60 countries / territories, and in over 80 different institutions at the national or subnational level.

## Components

Go.Data utilizes of the following tools and components:
