# Welcome to the Go.Data Site! 

This repository serves as an [umbrella site](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/) to gear the community towards existing technical documentation, resources, and open source components developed by and for the Go.Data community worldwide, particularly in the area of Analytics and Interoperability.

You can find all additional repos connected to the Go.Data tool in the overarching WHO Github Repository by filtering for topics = "go-data", as seen [here](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization?q=go-data&type=&language=).

## What is Go.Data? 

[Go.Data](https://www.who.int/tools/godata) is a software for contact tracing and outbreak response developed by WHO in collaboration with partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). Go.Data focuses on case and contact data including laboratory data, hospitalizaton and other variables collected through investigation forms that can be configured across settings and disease types. It generates contact follow-up lists and viusalisation of chains of tranmission. It is currently in use in over 60 countries / territories, and in over 80 different institutions at the national or subnational level.

## Components

Go.Data utilizes of the following tools and components:

Tool/Component | Description | Project Repository
--------- | --------- | ---------
Go.Data Installer | Creates installers for various system configurations | [GoDataSource-Installers**](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/GoDataSource-Installers) 
Mobile App |  IOS and Android applications of Go.Data. | [GoDataSource-MobileApp**](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/GoDataSource-MobileApp)
Push Notification Server | For wiping data from mobile devices. The feature can only be accessed if the required permissions are enabled. | [GoDataSource_PushNotificationServer**](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/GoDataSource_PushNotificationServer)
Front End Application | The web user interface part of Go.Data. | [GoDataSource-FrontEnd**](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/GoDataSource-FrontEnd)
Go.Data API | The backend of Go.Data that connects to the database, retrieves data etc.  | [GoDataSource-API**](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/GoDataSource-API)

 ** _these repositories are currently private and will be made public with time_ 

## In the [*Go.Data Docs Site*](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/), you can find:

###  Go.Data Analytics Scripts 

Example scripts and resources for extracting, cleaning, and running analyses. Output includes dashboards displaying operational performance metrics for contact tracing by contact tracing supervisor and teams. 

### Go.Data Interoperability Use Cases 

We've compiled existing integrations that partners and users have developed, and guidances on if you are considering connecting Go.Data to other system(s).

### Go.Data API Documentation
