# Project title
## Solution Overview
MicrobeTrace is a free, intuitive, dynamic and flexible tool to integrate epidemiological and genomic data and deliver vibrant data visualizations. Using simple point-and-click interfaces, data from surveillance, epi investigations, and genetic analyses can be readily imported, integrated and visualized...no coding required. MicrobeTrace is delivered by a web browser but runs locally on your computer. This means data and analyses are not sent over the web.

### Use Cases
In spite of the plethora of data visualization tools available, we felt there was a need for easy to use tools that can integrate epi and genomic data wihout the need for informatics/ programming skills. MicrobeTrace accepts a variety of input files:
•	Node lists (metadata)- CSV files
•	Edge lists (Contact tracing information/ genetic distance information)- CSV files
•	Molecular data- FASTA, NWK files, distance matrices
•	JSON files

## Implementation Setup
No downloads needed. Navigate to https://microbetrace.cdc.gov/MicrobeTrace/ and load files. The first time you use MicrobeTrace, an instance is downloaded onto your machine. After that, MicrobeTrace cab even be run without internet access.
