# Example Map in QGIS Using Data from Go.Data

Below we outline how to create a simple choropleth map of cases. We walk through exporting data manually from Go.Data, reformatting in Excel, and cleaning, aggregating and mapping case data in QGIS, an open source GIS application.

This is not meant to be a complete tutorial on how to make maps or use QGIS - this guide is helpful if you have some experience with QGIS and/or mapping. The guide uses a polygon GIS dataset (shapefile) with a unique identifier field that matches the unique identifier (Location_ID) of the case data exported from Go.Data. For sources of GIS data to make your own map using your own data, please see the document [GIS sources for location data set up].
