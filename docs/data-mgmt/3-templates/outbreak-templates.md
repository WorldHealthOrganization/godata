# WHO Standardized Outbreak Templates
One of the main advantages of Go.Data use for outbreak response is the ability to embed validated standards when performing case investigation, contact listing and contact tracing across disease types. This includes alignment with published standards and protocols by WHO technical teams when specifying variables and formats for data collection, such as the [WHO Outbreak Toolkit](https://www.who.int/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit). 

To facilitate such standards, Go.Data contains outbreak templates for common diseases. Using an outbreak template, you can quickly activate an outbreak in your Go.Data interface, with the relevant outbreak details and case investigation form structure already complete.

To see more information on how to set up and use Outbreak Templates, please visit the [Go.Data User Guide](https://sprcdn-assets.sprinklr.com/1652/254f53e1-35b0-4ca8-8452-99a46c413cab-1176881866.pdf).

To access installation files to begin collecting data for any of the below diseases, you can contact godata@who.int.

*Please note that the Go.Data v49 includes a template that aligns with the 2022 WHO CRF and CIF. Users who wish to utilize the most recent form are encouraged to import the mpox outbreak sync package along with the respective language file. Available options include:
1) [mpox sync package WITH reference data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-rzV5u3hyuce25MZ2A2_0A5YlAzsvzR/view?usp=drive_link): This option includes the outbreak forms, mpox-specific reference data, and a separate language file.
2) [mpox sync package](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gfZ2qkfx1aBimDViVvF1JlDFicWs_SRF/view?usp=drive_link): This option includes the outbreak forms and a separate language file. Users can create and customize mpox-specific reference data as needed.

**Important: The language file must be merged with the system's language file and should not be imported using the sync package.

To obtain credentials to the demo instance to see the template in use, kindly send an email to [godata@who.int](godata@who.int).
